# Masterarbeit
This repository contains the code for my Master's thesis. There are the following Matlab files:

## no_bc_upwind 
A function for generating the discretized Koopman Operator. Provided by Prof. Breiten

## BDF_Diff_Lyapunov
A function for solving the differnetial Lyapunov equation

## example 1 and example2
Two classes defining the flow of the two examples presented in the Chapter 'Numerical Results'

## observationC and observationD
Two classes defining the observation operators presented in the Chapter 'Numerical Results'

## system_for_endpoint_obs and system_for_trajectory_observation
Two classes where all the computation happens. One for the algorithms for R_T, one for R_C

## data
A script for generating and saving data

## test
A script for generating plots from data (quite messy)

## the folders generated_data and generated_plots
contain generated data and plots
